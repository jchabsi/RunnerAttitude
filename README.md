# RunnerAttitude - A Garmin Connect IQ Watch Face

Runner Attitude aims to keep your morale high and your mind focused on your wellbeing, displaying motivational phrases from its internal collection or your own self-motivation words.
Runner Attitude also displays a lot of information in a nice an easy to read layout with many elegant colorful themes to choose.

Runner Attitude is completely free to use. You will never find any restrictions!

However if you like it I encourage you to make a small donation to help me to buy my next pair of running shoes, or buying me an isotonic drink, or why not a beer :D
Link for donations: https://paypal.me/jchabsi Thanks a lot :)

Main features:

- Twinkling or scrolling motivational quotes that change according to a user configurable interval
- Possibility to set small non-scrolling fixed phrases or words instead of long scrolling phrases. (might save a bit of battery)
- You can set your own motivational phrase or the text that you want to display
- Select different colorful themes to renew Runner Attitude look and feel whenever you want
- Configurable runner avatar that shows your step goal progress. (Girl avatar, Boy, gender from watch settings, off)
- Date / Time
- Seconds on / off
- Heart rate
- Calories
- Steps goal
- Vertical Distance (Floors / Meters)
- Notifications
- Bluetooth on / off indicator
- Colorful battery indicator / Battery percentage

I have tried to support as many devices as possible but some legacy devices lack good resolution and colors thus the look and feel will be different from the screenshots.

Your feedback is very welcome!

I hope you enjoy it!
